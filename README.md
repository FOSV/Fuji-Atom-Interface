## Introduction 

The purpose of this project, via [HomeSpan](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan) or [ESPHome](https://github.com/esphome/esphome), is to be able to control your Fuji-Electric Air Conditioning internal unit from [HomeKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeKit) or [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

This is simply an interface between a Fuji-Electric internal unit (with 3-Wires remote control) and an Atom Lite (ESP32 based) device.

This interface was inspired by the project in the [Unreality's repo](https://github.com/unreality/FujiHK).

### Curiosity
[This](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/fujitsu-ac-heat-pump-integration-via-esphome-esp32/407610/80?u=fosv) is the first prototype I shared on [Home Assistant Community](https://community.home-assistant.io/).

## Platform

The tested version, so called [Atom Lite](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-controllers/products/atom-lite-esp32-development-kit), can be purchased on the offical site.

There is also a new version, [AtomS3 Lite](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atoms3-lite-esp32s3-dev-kit), available for purchase on the official site.

***Pease note, I have not tested the Fuji-Atom Interface on the new AtomS3 Lite, I only notice that the power pins are unchanged and the pin-matching between the Atom Lite and the AtomS3 Lite is the following:***
* ***G22 (Atom Lite) -> G5 (AtomS3 Lite)***
* ***G19 (Atom Lite) -> G6 (AtomS3 Lite)***

## Files usage

### Directory Tree:
* Fuji_HK_V1_Rev2.0.zip
	* Fuji_HK_V1_Rev2.0_Gerbers.zip
	* Fuji_HK_V1_Rev2.0_Schematic.pdf
* Fuji_HK_V2_Rev1.5.zip
	* Fuji_HK_V2_Rev1.5_Gerbers.zip
	* Fuji_HK_V2_Rev1.5_Schematic.pdf

When the JLCPCB site prompts you to upload Gerber files, directly upload the "Fuji_HK_V***x***_Rev***x.x***_Gerbers.zip" archive you have chosen.

There are two versions of the circuit:
* **V1_Rev2.0 ->** powers the Atom @3.3V on the appropriate pin
* **V2_Rev1.5 ->** powers the Atom @5V on the appropriate pin
	
Choose the one you prefer, there is no difference in the final operation.

***I prefer to use **V2_Rev1.5** to complain the Atom Lite specifications.***

## Connection
**‚ö†Ô∏è Please read the following instructions carefully, otherwise you may fry the PCB on your Indoor Unit ‚ö†**

**üõë PAY ATTENTIONüõë**  

**Before accessing any internal part of the indoor unit or remote control, make sure that you turn off the power to the Indoor Unit via the breaker in your electrical panel.**  
**If there is no dedicated switch for the Indoor Unit in your electrical panel, I recommend you to turn off the main breaker.**

**You need to connect the Fuji-Atom Interface in parallel with remote control.**

### Master/Slave configuration
The suggested configuration is that the Remote Control is the Master Unit and the Atom is the Slave Unit.  
To do so, make sure the Atom is **set via firmware** to be a **Slave Unit**. (If you use the [Unreality's firmware](https://github.com/unreality/FujiHK#secondary-mode), it will **automatically set itself as a Slave Unit**.)  
Also, make sure that you already have at least one Remote Control and that its **DIP-Switch 1-No.2** is set to **OFF** so that it assumes the role of **Master Unit**.  

If you decide to use the Remote Control as the Slave Unit and the Atom as the Master Unit, you have to set **DIP-Switch 1-No.2** of your Remote Control to **ON** while you have to set the Atom via firmware to be the Master Unit (Not recommended because **a Slave Unit will not work in the absence of a Master Unit**, so if the Atom dies you will not be able to control the Indoor Unit via Remote Control).

If you strangely do not have a Remote Control, you only need to set the Atom via firmware to be the Master Unit.

* **Red   (on Indoor Unit or RC Master Unit)  ->  12V (on Fuji-Atom Interface)**
* **White (on Indoor Unit or RC Master Unit)  ->  LIN (on Fuji-Atom Interface)**
* **Black (on Indoor Unit or RC Master Unit)  ->  GND (on Fuji-Atom Interface)**

## Components availability

In case a component is not available, replace it with one of equal characteristics.  
("Description" column of the BoM)

**üö´ Be careful, the two ICs (IC1 and U1) cannot be replaced because of different pins layout üö´**


Components of equal characteristics on the BOM can be found by typing the part number on [Octopart](https://octopart.com/).  
("Manufacturer Code" column of the BoM)

As for the capacitors, do not get stuck on the choice of temperature coefficient on the BOM if you should not find it, but quietly 
choose from these nine values: X5S X5R X5P X6S X6R X6P X7S X7R X7P.  
(The scale is: from the "worst" X5S, to the best X7P).
